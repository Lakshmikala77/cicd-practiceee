Building a CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, GitHub, Docker, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Hey Folks, I recently built a automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins that integrates with GitHub, Maven, Docker, DockerHub, Tomcat, and GKE. This pipeline takes code from source, builds & tests it, packages it as a Docker image, pushes it to DockerHub, and finally deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). All the tools were installed and configured on a Google Compute Engine (GCE) VM, which served as my Jenkins controller and execution environment.

🔗 Tools & Integrations
Here’s the tech stack we’re using:

Jenkins → Automation server to orchestrate the pipeline.
GitHub → Source code repository.
Maven → Build & dependency management tool for Java.
Docker → Containerization.
DockerHub → Image registry.
Tomcat → Application server to run the Java web app.
GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) → Kubernetes cluster where we deploy the app.

Each of these tools is connected to Jenkins with proper authentication:
🔐 Authentication Setup

* **GitHub → Jenkins**: Use GitHub plugin or webhooks. Generate a PAT (Personal Access Token) with repo access and add it in Jenkins credentials.
* **Maven**: Install Maven globally in Jenkins (`Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration`).
* **DockerHub**: Create a Jenkins credential (`username with Password`) with your DockerHub username & token/password.
* **Google Cloud (GKE)**:
 1. Create a service account with `roles/container.admin` and `roles/viewer`.
 2. Generate a private key for the service account (JSON format) and download it. Store this file securely since it cannot be recovered if lost.
 3. In Jenkins, navigate to `Manage Jenkins → Credentials → System → Global credentials → Add Credentials`.
 4. Select kind: **Google Service Account from Private Key**.
 5. Provide an ID (e.g., `kubernetes`) and project name.
 6. Upload the JSON key file and save it.
 7. Reference this credential in your Jenkinsfile for GKE deployment.

✅ Key Takeaways
1. Jenkins integrates seamlessly with GitHub, Maven, Docker, DockerHub, and GKE.
2. Store all secrets securely in Jenkins credentials.
3. Automating with Jenkinsfile ensures reproducibility & traceability.
4. Each code commit → Docker image pushed → App deployed on GKE.
5. Installing and running all tools on a GCE VM provides a consistent, cloud-based CI/CD environment.
